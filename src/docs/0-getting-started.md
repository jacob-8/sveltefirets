# Getting Started

## 1. Install SvelteFireTS and Firebase
`npm i -D sveltefirets firebase` or `pnpm add -D sveltefirets firebase`

## 2. Add [Firebase Project Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) Via Env Variables

- Add your Firebase config object for the project you use to develop with to a `.env` file in the same folder as `svelte.config.js` as a string:

```
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG={"apiKey":"...","authDomain":"YOURPROJECTID.firebaseapp.com","databaseURL":"https://YOURPROJECTID.firebaseio.com","projectId":"YOURPROJECTID","storageBucket":"YOURPROJECTID.appspot.com","messagingSenderId":"...","appId":"...","measurementId":"..."}
```

- SvelteFireTS will use these values the first time it is called to initialize. This will save your client side start time a few moments on pages that don't utilize Firebase if applicable. 

- If needing to access the config values in your site, just `import { firebaseConfig } from 'sveltefirets`;

- Any config placed into your hosting provider's env variables (e.g. Vercel) under the `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` key will automatically override these and allow for easy use of different projects between dev and production.

  - When using SvelteFireTS in non-SvelteKit environments, a file that exports `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` as a string will need to be aliased to `$env/static/public` as this library expects that to be available. *If this is not workable in your use case, feel free to submit a PR that updates `config.ts` to `process.env.PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` server-side or `window.PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` client side.*

- *If wanting to share config between projects in a monorepo set the [`envDir`](https://vitejs.dev/config/#envdir) property in your `vite.config.js` to `../../` and place the `.env` file in the repo root.*


## 3. Use
