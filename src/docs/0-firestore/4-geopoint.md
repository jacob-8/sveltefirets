# GeoPoint

Here is a simple comparison of Firebase GeoPoints vs regular objects that have the `latitude` and `longitude` properties. While queries can be made with [GeoFire](https://github.com/firebase/geofire-js) hashes, they do not utilize GeoPoints and thus there is no real benefit to using GeoPoints.
