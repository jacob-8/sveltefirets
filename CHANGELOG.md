# sveltefirets

## 0.0.34 - 5/4/2023

- update to latest SvelteKit 1.0+ package, update Firebase to 9.21.0
- [breaking] all imports must now be through the root package, `sveltefirets` instead of `sveltefirets/helpers/loader` for example.

## 0.0.32

- `authState` is set to `undefined` until `onAuthStateChanged()` either returns `null` or a Firebase User object enabling `$authState !== undefined` to be used to detect if auth has finished loading

## 0.0.31

- make all options except `startWith` on `Doc` and `Collection` components reactive

## 0.0.29

- - Breaking: Switched from adding a `firebaseConfig.ts` file manually and passing config to `sveltefirets` in the root layout (client) and hooks (server) to just placing it in the `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` .env variable. `firebaseConfig` values are not accessed by importing from `sveltefirets` as the library automatically reads the .env variables now. 

## 0.0.28

- - `loadScriptOnce` and `loadStylesOnce` dont mark script/style loaded until after it completes

## 0.0.27

- - Fix broken Firestore Lite methods by getting correct Firestore Lite instance

## 0.0.26

- - Using `providerIds` array instead of `signInMethod` on user object
 
## 0.0.25

- - Fix: User store will initialize immediately after firebase config set. v0.0.24 introduced a bug whereby the User store wouldn't initialize until something else called Firebase into action.
  - Deprecated `updateUserData()` in favor of `saveUserData()` which accepts entire authResult object from FirebaseUi for Web to add `signInMethod` and `emailVerified` fields to the base user object. Correspondingly deprecated the `updateuserdata` event in favor of `authresult` for `FirebaseUiAuth.svelte`.

## 0.0.24

- - Add `continueUrl` prop to `FirebaseUiAuth.svelte` to make passwordless email authentication feasible using a landing page in single-page apps that conditionally load `FirebaseUiAuth` 

## 0.0.21

- - First version where installed package version successfully works from both server and client side when installed in another project.

## 0.0.19

- - Removed need to pass Firebase config to `FirebaseUiAuth.svelte` component (and code optimizations)

## 0.0.18

- - Inited firebaseApp no longer needs passed into data retrieving functions server side. Instead, Firebase config must be passed to SvelteFireTS in the root `__layout.svelte` load client side and in `hooks.ts` server side.
